## Overview
When basic steps don't help, check Battery Health, charging cycles, and screen-on time to understand why your iPhone battery is draining.

## Symptoms
- Battery drains even after limiting background apps
- Battery Health shows reduced capacity
- Phone needs charging multiple times per day

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check Battery Health
Go to Settings, then Battery, then tap Battery Health & Charging. You'll see a percentage — above 80% is generally healthy. Voice: "Open Settings, then Battery, then tap Battery Health and Charging. What percentage does it show?"

### Step 2: Review Charging Habits
Avoid leaving the phone on charge at 100% for long periods. Optimized Battery Charging (in the same screen) helps by learning your routine. Tap the toggle in the upper right to ensure it's on.

### Step 3: Screen-On Time
In Settings > Battery, scroll to see "Screen On" and "Screen Off" time. If Screen On is very high, consider reducing brightness or screen timeout: Settings > Display & Brightness.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If Battery Health shows "Service" or you experience unexpected shutdowns, contact Apple Support for a battery check.
