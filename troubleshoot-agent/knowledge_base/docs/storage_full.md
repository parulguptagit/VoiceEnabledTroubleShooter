## Overview
When your iPhone says storage is full, use iCloud Optimize, delete large attachments, and prefer streaming over downloading.

## Symptoms
- "Storage Almost Full" alert
- Can't take photos or install apps
- Settings > General > iPhone Storage shows full bar

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Turn On iCloud Photos Optimize
Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Photos. Tap "Optimize iPhone Storage" so full-resolution photos are in iCloud and smaller versions stay on device. Voice: "In Settings, tap your name at the top, then iCloud, then Photos. Choose Optimize iPhone Storage."

### Step 2: Delete Large Attachments in Messages
Open Messages, tap a conversation, tap the contact name at the top, then tap "See All Photos" or "Info." Delete large videos or images. Voice: "In Messages, open a chat, tap the name at the top, then see all photos and remove big files."

### Step 3: Stream Instead of Download
For Music and Video, use "Stream" or "Don't Download" so files aren't stored on the device. In Settings > Music or TV, turn off "Download" or set to stream only.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If you've freed space but the alert persists, or you can't identify what's using space, contact Apple Support.
