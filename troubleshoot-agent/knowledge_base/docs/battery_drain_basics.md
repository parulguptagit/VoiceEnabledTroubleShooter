## Overview
If your iPhone battery drains faster than expected, the cause is often background activity, screen brightness, or settings that use a lot of power. This guide covers Settings > Battery, Background App Refresh, and Low Power Mode.

## Symptoms
- Battery percentage drops quickly during normal use
- Phone feels warm when not in heavy use
- Battery runs out before end of day

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check Battery Usage
Open Settings — that's the grey gear icon on your home screen — then scroll down and tap Battery. You'll see a list of apps and their battery usage. Look at the last 24 hours or 10 days. Visually, the Battery screen shows a graph at the top; for voice, say "scroll down to see which apps use the most battery."

### Step 2: Turn Off Background App Refresh for Heavy Apps
Stay in Settings and tap General, then Background App Refresh. Either turn it off completely or turn it off for specific apps that appear in your Battery list. Tap the blue toggle to turn off — it's in the upper right of each app row.

### Step 3: Enable Low Power Mode
Go back to Settings > Battery. Tap Low Power Mode and turn it on. You can also add Low Power Mode to Control Center: Settings > Control Center, then tap the green plus next to Low Power Mode.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If battery health is below 80% or you see "Service" under Battery Health, consider a battery replacement.
