## Overview
Display problems can often be improved with calibration, True Tone, refresh rate, and touch sensitivity settings.

## Symptoms
- Screen too dim or too bright
- Colors look wrong
- Touch not responding well
- Motion feels choppy

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Display & Brightness
Go to Settings > Display & Brightness. Adjust the brightness slider. Turn "True Tone" on or off to see if colors improve. Voice: "Open Settings, Display and Brightness. Move the brightness slider and try toggling True Tone."

### Step 2: Refresh Rate (Pro models)
On iPhone 13 Pro and later, go to Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Limit Frame Rate. Try turning it off for smoother motion, or on to save battery. Voice: "In Settings, go to Accessibility, then Motion. Tap Limit Frame Rate and try changing it."

### Step 3: Touch Sensitivity
Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Touch Accommodations. You can adjust hold duration and ignore repeat. Voice: "In Settings, Accessibility, Touch, then Touch Accommodations to adjust how the screen responds to touches."

## When to Contact Apple Support
If the screen is physically damaged, has lines, or doesn't respond at all, contact Apple Support.
