## Overview
Use the Recommendations tab in Storage settings and app offloading to manage iPhone storage.

## Symptoms
- Want to prevent storage from filling up
- Need to see what uses the most space
- Want to free space without losing data

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Use Storage Recommendations
Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage. At the top you'll see recommendations like "Offload Unused Apps" or "Review Large Attachments." Tap each and follow the steps. Voice: "Open Settings, General, iPhone Storage. At the top, tap any recommendation to act on it."

### Step 2: Offload Unused Apps
In the same screen, scroll to the list of apps. Tap an app you rarely use and tap "Offload App." This removes the app but keeps its documents and data; you can reinstall from the App Store later. Voice: "In iPhone Storage, tap an app you don't need often and choose Offload App."

### Step 3: Review Large Files
In iPhone Storage, tap "Documents & Data" or scroll to see large items. Delete or move files you don't need.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If recommendations don't appear or you need help with iCloud vs device storage, contact Apple Support.
