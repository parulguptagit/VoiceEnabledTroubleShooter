## Overview
If your iPhone is overheating, force quitting apps, using airplane mode to cool down, and updating iOS can help.

## Symptoms
- Phone is hot to touch
- Warning: "iPhone needs to cool down"
- Performance is slow

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Force Quit Apps
Swipe up from the bottom and hold (or double-click Home), then swipe up on each app to close. This stops background CPU use. Voice: "Swipe up from the bottom and hold to see all open apps, then swipe each one up to close."

### Step 2: Airplane Mode Cool-Down
Turn on Airplane Mode: swipe down from the top-right corner to open Control Center, then tap the airplane icon. Leave it on for a few minutes in a cool place. Voice: "Swipe down from the top right, then tap the airplane icon."

### Step 3: Update iOS
Go to Settings > General > Software Update. If an update is available, install it. Updates often include thermal and performance fixes.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If overheating happens during normal use or the warning appears repeatedly, contact Apple Support.
