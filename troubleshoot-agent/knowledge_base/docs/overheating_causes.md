## Overview
iPhones can get warm during heavy use. Common causes include CPU-intensive apps, direct sunlight, and charging while gaming or using GPS.

## Symptoms
- Back of phone feels hot
- "Temperature" warning appears
- Phone slows down or dims display

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Remove from Heat
Move the phone out of direct sunlight and into a cooler place. Remove any case that might trap heat.

### Step 2: Close Heavy Apps
Swipe up from the bottom (or double-click Home on older models) to open the app switcher. Swipe up on apps that use camera, games, or video to close them. Voice: "Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to see open apps, then swipe up on each to close."

### Step 3: Avoid Charging While Heavy Use
If you're gaming or using GPS, unplug the charger until the phone cools. Charging plus heavy use generates more heat.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If the phone gets hot during light use or shows a temperature warning often, contact Apple Support.
