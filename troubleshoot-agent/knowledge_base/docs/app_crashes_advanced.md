## Overview
When common fixes don't work, consider crash logs, storage headroom, and RAM management.

## Symptoms
- Crashes continue after reinstall
- Multiple apps crash
- Device feels slow before crash

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Free Up Storage
Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage. If storage is nearly full, delete large apps or media. Leave at least a few GB free. Voice: "Open Settings, General, then iPhone Storage. See how much space is used and free up space if it's almost full."

### Step 2: Restart the iPhone
Hold the side button and either volume button until the slider appears. Drag to power off. Wait 30 seconds, then press the side button to turn on. Voice: "Hold the side button and one volume button until you see the power-off slider, then slide to turn off."

### Step 3: Update iOS
Settings > General > Software Update. Install the latest update. Crashes are often fixed in updates.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If crashes persist after a full restore or you see repeated kernel panics, contact Apple Support and consider sharing crash logs.
