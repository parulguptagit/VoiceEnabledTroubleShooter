## Overview
When your iPhone won't connect to Wi-Fi or keeps disconnecting, try forgetting the network, checking DNS, and switching router bands.

## Symptoms
- Wi-Fi icon shows but no internet
- Connection drops repeatedly
- "Unable to join network" message

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Forget the Network
Go to Settings — tap the grey gear icon — then Wi-Fi. Tap the (i) icon on the right of your network name. Tap "Forget This Network" at the top. Then rejoin by selecting the network again and entering the password. Visually: the (i) is in the right side of the row; for voice: "tap the small i next to your Wi-Fi name."

### Step 2: Check DNS Settings
In Settings > Wi-Fi, tap (i) next to your network. Scroll to "Configure DNS" and tap it. If it's Manual, try switching to Automatic, or add 8.8.8.8 as a DNS server.

### Step 3: Restart Router and iPhone
Turn off your Wi-Fi router for 30 seconds, then turn it back on. On iPhone, turn Wi-Fi off and on: Settings > Wi-Fi, tap the toggle at the top (upper right).

## When to Contact Apple Support
If the issue persists on multiple networks, hardware may be involved.
