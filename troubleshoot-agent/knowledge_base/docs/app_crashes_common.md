## Overview
When an app closes unexpectedly or won't open, try force quit, reinstall, offload, and check iOS compatibility.

## Symptoms
- App closes immediately after opening
- "Unexpectedly quit" message
- App freezes then closes

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Force Quit and Reopen
Swipe up from the bottom and hold to see the app switcher. Swipe up on the app to close it. Then tap the app icon again to open. Voice: "Swipe up from the bottom and hold, then swipe the app up to close it. Open it again from the home screen."

### Step 2: Offload the App
Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage. Find the app in the list and tap it. Tap "Offload App" — this removes the app but keeps its data. Then reinstall from the App Store. Voice: "In Settings, go to General, then iPhone Storage. Tap the app name and choose Offload App."

### Step 3: Check iOS Compatibility
In the App Store, open the app page and check "Requires iOS X.X or later." Go to Settings > General > Software Update to see your version. Update iOS if needed.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If many apps crash or the device restarts randomly, contact Apple Support.
