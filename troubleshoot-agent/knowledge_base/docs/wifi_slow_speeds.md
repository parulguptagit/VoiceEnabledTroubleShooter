## Overview
Slow Wi-Fi on iPhone can be caused by interference, using 2.4 GHz instead of 5 GHz, or needing a network reset.

## Symptoms
- Web pages load slowly
- Video buffers often
- Speed test shows low Mbps

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Prefer 5 GHz If Available
If your router has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, connect to the 5 GHz network (usually faster and less crowded). In Settings > Wi-Fi, tap (i) next to your network to see the band. Voice: "In Wi-Fi settings, tap the i next to your network and check if it says 5 GHz."

### Step 2: Reduce Interference
Move closer to the router and away from microwaves or other electronics. Restart the router.

### Step 3: Reset Network Settings
As a last step, go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This removes saved Wi-Fi passwords and VPN settings. You'll need to rejoin Wi-Fi and re-enter passwords.

## When to Contact Apple Support
If speeds are slow on every network, contact Apple Support.
